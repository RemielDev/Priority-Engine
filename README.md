## What is it?
A simple Roblox framework module/controller loader which is designed to streamline and organize the process of initializing and managing game components, ensuring a smooth and efficient game operation. The loader operates in two primary phases: module initialization and controller loading; with the added functionality of _G.import().

## Module Initialization
In the first phase, the loader starts by initializing modules, which are foundational elements containing reusable code that can be employed across various parts of the game. These modules might include libraries, utilities, or any standalone functionalities that do not directly interact with the gameâ€™s client or server scripts but provide essential services or data structures required by the controllers.
